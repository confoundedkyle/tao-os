    body: `
The **ATS** module is your candidate pipeline inside Calyflow. Candidates are
shown by stage — sourced, screening, interview, offer, hired, rejected — and tied
to the **project (role)** they're being considered for.

## Where the data comes from

Candidates flow in from a connected **applicant tracking system** — Greenhouse,
Lever, Bullhorn, Ashby, Workable, SmartRecruiters, and more — or you can add them
by hand. See the [ATS connectors](/docs/connectors).

## What you can do

- Browse and filter candidates across your roles.
- See where each candidate sits in the process.
- Feed candidates into agents (e.g. CV screening, outreach).

**Example:** filter to the candidates at the "Screening" stage for an open role
and run the CV Screener on just that group to rank them.

## Turning it on

An admin enables it under **Settings → Modules**. Turning it off hides the module
but keeps all your candidate data.

  crm: {
    key: "crm",
    title: "CRM module",
    lead: "The companies you work with and the people at them.",
    body: `
The **CRM** module tracks your **accounts** (companies) and the **leads** (people)
connected to them — your business-development side of recruiting.

## Where the data comes from

Accounts and leads sync from a connected **CRM** — HubSpot, Pipedrive, Attio,
Zoho CRM, and more — or you can add them manually. See the
[CRM connectors](/docs/connectors).

## What you can do

- Keep client companies and their contacts in one place.
- Give agents (e.g. client prospecting research) the context they need.

**Example:** before a business-development call, open the account to see its open
deals and the right contact, then run Client Prospecting Research for a brief.

## Turning it on

An admin enables it under **Settings → Modules**. Turning it off hides the module
but preserves your accounts and leads.

  "talent-pool": {
    key: "talent-pool",
    title: "Talent Pool module",
    lead: "A pipeline of interesting people to keep warm — not tied to a single role.",
    body: `
The **Talent Pool** is a database of prospects you want to keep warm for the
future — strong people who aren't attached to one specific role. Each prospect can
carry skills, notes, contact details, and a CV.

## Where the data comes from

Prospects come from **sourcing & enrichment tools** (and manual adds). Sourcing
agents can add the people they find here. See the
[sourcing & enrichment connectors](/docs/connectors).

## What you can do

- Build a niche bench of talent for repeat roles.
- Store skills, notes, and CVs against each prospect.
- Pull prospects into outreach when the right role opens.

**Example:** you regularly place fintech backend engineers — keep a warm pool of
them, and when a new role opens, pull the best-matched prospects straight into an
outreach run.

## Turning it on

An admin enables it under **Settings → Modules**. Turning it off hides the module
but keeps every prospect.
